- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AlvaroGiAn

I am currently finishing my Master Degree in Biomedical Engineering, specialization in biomechanics. 
I am interested in the fieeld of physical Human Robot Collaboration and Cognitive Robotics. 

I am looking forward to keep developing myself in that direction, but mostly, I am always looking forward to meet 
new people and face new projects.
